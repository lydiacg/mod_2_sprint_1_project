# Mental Health in the Tech Industry

This is the repository for my project for Module 2 (Statistical Inference), Sprint 1. This sprint has primarily focused on SQL skills and an introduction to inference, so I will be focusing on these skills. 

I have attempted to answer the below question in order to provide employers with context about how wide spread mental illness and which demographic groups (specifically age and gender) are most suspectable. 

1. Who responded to this survey? Are the respondents representative of the wider population?
    1. Age
    1. Gender
1. How many respondents have experienced mental health disorders?
    1. All Respondents
    1. Age
    1. Gender
1. Which mental health disorders had the highest prevalence rate?
    1. All Respondents
    1. Age
    1. Gender

I found that mental illness are common in the tech industry, with 62% of respondents or more reporting mental illnesses each year. There was a significant difference between genders, with women and TGNB individuals reporting mental illness at higher rates than men, but there was not a significant difference across age groups. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, ADHD and addictive disorders were the most prevalent disorders.
